### Environmental Health Project

This is a simple statistical analysis that I performed for a friend of mine. He is an ER resident who gave a series of lectures on the impact of the environment on our health. Before and after the lecture, he gave a survey to collect data on the attendee's knowledge of environmental health topics and opinions on the seriousness of the topic. There were a number of different data types with over 300 students attending lectures over three years enabling temporal analysis and requiring statistical support.
